## Introduction

This project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to create an E-Learning Website. The website includes sections for information about the institution, programming language courses, video tutorials, and contact details.

## Sections

### About

The "About" section provides detailed information about the B.S. Abdur Rahman Crescent Institute of Science and Technology, highlighting its history, academic offerings, and the unique learning environment.

### Courses

The "Programming Languages Courses" section displays links to various programming language courses. Each course is represented by a clickable box with a background image.

### Video Tutorials

In the "Video Tutorials" section, you can find educational videos on different topics. Each video includes playback controls for the user's convenience.

### Contact

The "Contact" section provides contact information for the institution, including an email address and a phone number. Clicking the "Contact" button triggers a JavaScript function to display an alert.

## Styling

The styling is done using CSS to create a visually appealing and responsive layout. The design incorporates a clean header, navigation menu, and visually appealing course boxes. The color scheme is consistent throughout the website.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript file, `learn.js`, includes a function named `showAlert()`. This function is triggered when the "Contact" button is clicked, displaying an alert message expressing gratitude for reaching out.
